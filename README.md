A very simple addon. Adds a small "Run" Button to the Toolbar. 

When selected, the addon searches through your projects' directories,

and displays any EditorScripts in a PopupMenu.

From there, selecting any of the options will run the corresponding

EditorScript's _run() function.

---

Obviates the need to manually navigate and open an EditorScript,

then call File->Run, one-at-a-time.
